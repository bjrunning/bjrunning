## Projects

### [Brain Games](https://github.com/bjrunning/java-project-61)
One project - it introduces the basic steps required to start any new project: installing the language, setting up the environment (operating system, editor, linters), connecting additional libraries, creating a git repository.

Introducing Gradle, a framework that helps manage a project, install and update additional libraries, compile a project, build it, and much more.

Introduction to Ubuntu (the principles of operation of operating systems, the mechanism for installing applications through package managers, the operation of the file system (executable files, rights), terminal, checkstyle, github

‚ÄúBrain Games‚Äù is a set of five console games built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain training. Each game asks questions that must be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Wrong answers end the game and prompt you to play it again. Games:
  
  - Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated.
  - Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
  - Definition of an even number.
  - Determination of the greatest common divisor.
  - Definition of a prime number.

### [Difference Calculator](https://github.com/bjrunning/java-project-71)
A difference calculator is a program that determines the difference between two data structures. This is a popular task, for which there are many online services, for example: http://www.jsondiff.com/. A similar mechanism is used when outputting tests or automatically tracking changes in configuration files.

Utility features:
  
  - Supports different input formats: yaml and json
  - Generating a report in the form of plain text, stylish and json

Usage: JUnit, TDD

### [Data Validator](https://github.com/bjrunning/java-project-78)
Data validator is a library that can be used to check the correctness of any data. There are many similar libraries in every language, since almost all programs work with external data that needs to be checked for correctness. First of all, we are talking about data from forms filled out by users. The project is based on the yup library.

### [Analyze Website](https://github.com/bjrunning/java-project-72)
A full-fledged website based on the Javalin framework. Here the basic principles of building modern websites on MVC architecture are worked out: working with routing, request handlers and a template engine, interacting with a database via ORM.

All web development (backend) is based on two things: the HTTP protocol and client-server architecture.

The SQL code itself to create the database structure is generated using migrations that are built into the ORM. The same ORM is needed to perform SQL queries against the database: inserting, modifying and deleting data.

Using Bootstrap and testing sites (it is mainly built around tests that simulate HTTP requests and check the responses along with the data in the database).

To run a website you need a web server and an installed database. In turn, networking relies on a basic understanding of the TCP protocol and familiarity with the concept of IP address and port. The process of deploying a local environment.

In this project, the most automated method is being developed, using the Railway service. This is a hosting operating on a PaaS (platform as a service) model, it is responsible for the infrastructure itself and requires a certain way of organizing the code to ensure scalability.
